## How old is the Reddcoin project?
Reddcoin's chain started on January 20, 2014 as a Scrypt Proof of Work (PoW) digital currency via a Initial Public Coin Offering (IPCO) on BitcoinTalk.Org with a goal of becoming a new cryptocurrency fully integrated into social media. After raising upwards of $100,000 in funding through the IPCO to support development, Reddcoin was released to the public on February 2, 2014. In exchange for financial support, 5.45 billion reddcoins were distributed to IPCO investors over the course of 90 days beginning in mid-February.

## What is Reddcoin? 
Reddcoin is a first generation cryptocurrency launched in 2014. A cryptocurrency is a digital peer-to-peer medium of exchange with no central authority or banks managing its transactions, unlike fiat money that derives its value from government regulation or law (e.g. The U.S. Dollar, Euro, etc.). You do not need a bank or any third party to use cryptocurrency.
Simply put, Reddcoin is digital money with real monetary value. Reddcoin is a decentralized, blockchain-based cryptocurrency used to tip or send payments for social content. The Reddcoin API supports all social platforms, from Reddit to Twitter and Twitch. This allows you as a user to send or receive payments without a middleman across your favorite social platforms for the content you create and enjoy.
 
## What is Reddcoin’s purpose?
Reddcoin will be dedicated to tipping on social networks as a way to bring cryptocurrency awareness to the general public. Social networks are now part of our everyday lives. They give every person on this planet a fair chance at showing the world how awesome they are. Getting an upvote, like, or retweet for your well-received comment or picture is fun, but unfortunately, they have no real value. Fortunately, there is now something better than imaginary internet points – Reddcoins.
Cryptocurrency is complicated. Let’s face it – The average person has no idea how cryptocurrency works. They would like to get involved, but usually have no idea where to start.
Reddcoin will fill those voids by integrating a seamless cryptocurrency tipping system with all major social networks to make the process of exchanging coins simple, fun, and rewarding both for the giver and the receiver.
 
## How will Reddcoins be used?
Reddcoin was built to be a full-fledged social network coin. The developers are currently building a central hub that will manage the various social media tipping accounts that will be created on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc. The plan is to make Reddcoin into a hybrid of e-currency/crypto, reward points, etc. Basically, Reddcoin will be internet points but with actual monetary value.
The idea is to have a system which will make it easy for people and businesses to auto-tip people, re-posts, etc. Then people can use their Reddcoins on websites to purchase items or use them in games like Freemium games which have in-game credits that you purchase, but you can use Reddcoins instead.
This would benefit businesses, developers, & users. If you buy credits in-game, you're stuck to using them only in that game. Instead, if you have Reddcoins, you can use them elsewhere which would make you more positive about spending money in a game since you can easily move it.
The plan is for Reddcoin to be the internet's official "like" button. Can you imagine being tipped on Instagram for your picture upload, on Facebook for your location check-in, on YouTube for a silly video you uploaded, on Reddit for your witty comment, etc. then being able to exchange all those Reddcoins instantly for physical goods or gift cards? Or even transferring all your Reddcoins to a game you love playing? You would be getting paid for stuff that takes zero effort that you already do for free.

## Why do ReddCoins have value?
ReddCoins have value because they are a form of money. They can be spent as tender & accepted as a form of payment.

## What determines ReddCoin’s value?
ReddCoin’s price is determined by supply & demand. If demand for ReddCoins increases, its value will increase. If demand for ReddCoins decrease, its price will decrease. When more social networks & games integrate ReddCoin, the demand for more ReddCoins will increase. There is only a limited number of ReddCoins currently in circulation and there will be limited supply from 31 billion ReddCoins to ever exist (you have to considerate ReddCoin as a staking coin with inflation up to 5% annually as a set up, but real inflation rate of ~3% last few years). Stakers which are also securing the network are creating more ReddCoins at a decreasing and predictable rate. These attributes influence ReddCoin’s level of inflation to grow at a steady and healthy rate, allowing for a stable value.

## What separates ReddCoin from other cryptocurrencies?
* ReddCoin had a successful IPCO (Initial Public Coin Offering) prior to its public launch. The purpose of an IPCO is to raise capital to monetize the investments of early investors and to raise funds for business-related expenses to expand ReddCoin’s network and infrastructure. 386 investors pledged 168.83470154 BitCoins during ReddCoin’s IPCO. This means $100,000+ USD is financially backing ReddCoin. Many cryptocurrencies suffer from IPCO scams, failed launches, & zero financial backing. ReddCoin did not have any of these problems.
* ReddCoin is a community driven cryptocurrency. This means there is no reliance on ReddCoin’s developers to complete all of the work such as advertising ReddCoin to potential users, programming social network tipbots, designing ReddCoin-related website layouts, etc. The community tries to help the developers & newcomers with anything they can. In result, /r/ReddCoin has become the fourth largest crypto community on Reddit (as of 3/15/14). There are over 100 crypto related subs on Reddit & ReddCoin has only been public since 2/2/14.
* Many cryptocurrencies suffer from the “multipool” problem. Multipools are pools miners use to mine the most profitable coin for the sole purpose of profit. Because multipool miners are only mining for profit with zero intention of holding their coins, this can lead to massive sell walls on exchanges. Sell walls are large amounts of coins sitting on exchanges waiting to be sold. Sell walls indicate there is more supply than demand & they can lower the value of coins. ReddCoin’s scrypt implements the Kimoto Gravity Well to deter multipools from mining ReddCoin. This prevents major dumps of ReddCoin on exchanges.
* The tipbots of other cryptocurrencies are often created by different individuals on a best-effort basis with different implementations in different languages, run on different servers, and use different commands and responses. This lack of consistency can lead to suboptimal user experience. All of ReddCoins current tipbots (Twitter, Twitch.TV, Justin.TV, etc.) were created by the same developer & use the same set of commands & generate the same set of responses. This is to ensure consistent and uniform user experience across multiple social networks, regardless where you're tipping.
